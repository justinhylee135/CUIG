## Base Models for Unlearning

Place all base models required to initiate the unlearning process in this directory. Ensure each model is in the [Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) format.

To obtain the base model checkpoint used in our experiments, visit the [UnlearnCanvas repository](https://github.com/OPTML-Group/UnlearnCanvas) and follow the installation instructions provided there.
