UnlearnCanvas relies on two classifiers: an object classifier and a style classifier. 

To set up these classifiers:

1. Download the pre-trained models from the [UnlearnCanvas GitHub repository](https://github.com/OPTML-Group/UnlearnCanvas).
2. Rename the downloaded files to `object_classifier.pth` and `style_classifier.pth`.
3. Place both files in this directory.

These classifiers are required for UnlearnCanvas to function correctly.
